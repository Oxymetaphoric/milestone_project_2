### Project Goals

This is my milestone two project for the [Code Institute's](http://www.codeinstitute.net/) *'Level 5 Diploma in Web Application Development'*. The goal of this project is to *Design, develop and implement a dynamic Front end web application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript*. To this end I am building a website that will connect to the [Netrunner Database](http://www.netrunnerdb.com) API, download, manipulate, and display card data in the JSON format, and allow users to build a deck of cards for the card game [Netrunner](http://www.nullsignalgames.com/about/netrunner/), exporting completed decks as a printable pdf or uploading to netrunnerdb.

#### User Goals

- browse the database of Netrunner cards
- filter the cards displayed by various properties
- add and remove cards from their current deck
- upload completed decks to netrunnerdb to share them with other players
- remove all cards and start again

#### Site Operator Goals

- provide a robust and easily accessible tool for deckbuilding
- promote the game of Netrunner

#### Developer Goals

- develop on knowledge of manipulating JSON and array methods
- Develop a site that satisfies the Goals of the Users and Operator as determined by the User Stories and Goals
- create a visually interesting and well-optimised experience
- Build a performant and efficient site, benchmarked using tools such as lighthouse, that is workable on all modern browsers and devices
